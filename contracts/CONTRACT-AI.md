# AI Contract

Owner: integrations-ai.

Default AI provider is `fake`. Deterministic fake output is the default for every endpoint. A live AI
provider is permitted for supported endpoints under the AI hard gate (see below); it is off by default
and test-isolated. All endpoints are routed through the `resolveAiProvider` seam.

## Milestone 7 Fake AI Foundation

All AI endpoints use deterministic fake outputs while `AI_PROVIDER=fake`:

- `POST /api/ai/campaign-copy`: returns campaign copy variants from a prompt.
- `POST /api/ai/reply-suggestion`: returns a suggested reply from supplied messages or a tenant-scoped conversation.
- `POST /api/ai/conversation-summary`: returns a deterministic conversation summary.
- `POST /api/ai/lead-qualification`: returns deterministic score, stage, and reasons.

All endpoints select their provider through `resolveAiProvider()`:

- **Default `fake`** — byte-for-byte the prior deterministic suggestion; records `AI_REQUEST` with
  `provider: "fake"`. Unchanged.
- **Live** — used **only** when the AI hard gate (`lib/ai/ai-gate.ts#evaluateAiHardGate`) allows, i.e.
  `AI_PROVIDER=live` **and** `LIVE_AI_ENABLED=true` **and** `AI_API_KEY` present **and** `AI_COST_ACK=true`.
  Any missing condition falls back to `fake` (fail-safe). Enabling live requires human-supplied secrets +
  cost acknowledgement — a hard gate; never enabled in CI or demo.

Successful fake AI endpoint calls record one local `AI_REQUEST` usage event with fake-provider metadata. This is local analytics/metering only and must not call billing providers, live AI providers, messaging providers, notifications, or external services.

## Outbound/Inbound Isolation & Safety Rules

All live AI provider interactions must adhere to strict safety bounds:

1. **Analysis and draft only** — AI endpoints never directly trigger external messaging, notifications, billing changes, or database mutations of tenant configurations. Live output is always drafted for review.
2. **PII Redaction** — Prompts strip raw PII (such as phone-like runs redacted) and prompt/response bodies are never logged in the clear (PII-safe logger, SPEC-006).
3. **Usage Metering & Cap** — A per-tenant daily cap (`AI_DRAFT_DAILY_CAP`, default 100) bounds live requests; over the cap returns 429. Live usage records `AI_REQUEST` with `provider: "live"`. The `ai:check` gate asserts these invariants.

## Post-MVP Local AI Operations

`/settings/ai` renders the local AI safety boundary. It may display selected provider metadata, fake-provider readiness, endpoint coverage, AI usage totals, and recent local `AI_REQUEST` usage events.

This view is read-only. It must not submit prompts, call live AI providers, mutate conversations, expose API keys, create billing provider artifacts, send notifications, or enable live AI.
