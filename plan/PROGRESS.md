# plan/PROGRESS.md — execution tracker

Update one row per item as you work it (Todo → In Progress → Done/Blocked). Keep current-only; history is
in `git log`. "Verified" = the real commands ran and passed (e2e is "not run" without Postgres).

## Log (most recent first)
- 2026-05-30 — **SPEC-018 Distributed Redis-Backed Rate Limiter DONE.** Implemented robust distributed rate limiting inside `lib/rate-limit/api-rate-limit.ts` using dynamic runtime imports (`/* webpackIgnore: true */`) to prevent Next.js edge middleware Webpack compilation issues, isolating `ioredis` in `lib/rate-limit/redis-rate-limiter-impl.ts`. Implemented atomic transactions (`MULTI`, `INCR`, `PTTL`, `PEXPIRE`) for accurate distributed rate calculations, with graceful fast fallback (`maxRetriesPerRequest: 1`, `enableOfflineQueue: false`) to the in-memory Map store in case of Redis connection drops. Added 5 vitest unit tests in `tests/unit/rate-limit/redis-rate-limit.test.ts` verifying all success, block, failure, and fallback modes. Verified 100% green linter, typecheck, unit tests, playwright smoke tests, and Next.js production build.
- 2026-05-30 — **SPEC-017 Phone Number Lookup Validation Seam DONE.** Shipped the centralized `lib/validation/lookup.ts` containing the `evaluatePhoneNumberLookup()` resolver which format-sanitizes strings to E.164 natively by default, and gates a live Twilio Lookup API validator (`client.lookups.v2.phoneNumbers` via fetch) checking for mobile line-types if `LIVE_LOOKUP_ENABLED=true`. Integrated into the single contact create (`app/api/contacts/route.ts` POST) and batch CSV import (`lib/csv/import-contacts.ts` + API route). Added 12 vitest unit tests covering local standardization, mock live responses, landline rejections, and graceful fallback behaviors. Verified 100% green linting and 467 tests successfully passing.
- 2026-05-30 — **SPEC-016 BullMQ Worker Production Hardening DONE.** Added graceful shutdown hooks (SIGTERM/SIGINT), configurable locking properties (lockDuration, stalledInterval), centralized worker error monitoring/fail listeners with PII-safe logging and metric dispatch, and configurable job options TTL parameters (removeOnComplete, removeOnFail). Verified 100% green linting and 455 unit tests successfully passing.
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-015 SMS delivery/queue/webhook metrics counters DONE.** Extended the centralized `lib/observability/metrics.ts` with the `recordMetric()` helper. Structured and instrumented the five required pipeline counters: delivery rate, send-to-delivered latency, queue depth, failure-by-error-code, and webhook-verification failure rate at existing seams (Twilio webhooks validation/status transitions, database queue repositories, BullMQ worker enqueues). Defensively redacts PII context and gates behavior on `OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED`. Added a comprehensive unit test suite, extended `observability:check`, and verified a full local gate (`npm run validate` 19/19 checks green).
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-014 write-once consent evidence immutability DONE.** Enforced write-once immutability for contact consent evidence fields (`consentCapturedAt`, `consentMethod`, `consentDisclosure`) at the application layer. First capture, no-op writes, and unrelated fields updates are allowed; updates attempting to overwrite existing evidence fields with a different non-empty value are rejected with a tenant-safe error. Covered by a new Vitest unit test suite (10 specs) and verified full local gate (19/19 checks green).
- 2026-05-29 — **AFK 12h readiness setup (no app code changed).** Made the full protected gate green on
  Windows: `db:generate` → retry wrapper `scripts/db-generate.ts` (transient EPERM); `docker-compose`
  services pinned `restart: unless-stopped`; added `scripts/agent/afk-preflight.sh` (`npm run afk:preflight`)
  = services up + migrate + seed + Playwright Chromium + `local-gate.ps1`. Verified: **full `npm run validate`
  GREEN end-to-end incl `e2e:smoke`** (first full e2e this session) + build; `PREFLIGHT=0`. Authored AFK work
  queue `plan/specs/SPEC-011..015` (demo-safe, no secrets) + `scripts/agent/afk-12h.ps1` launcher +
  `docs/AFK_RUNBOOK.md`; refreshed SUMMARY/BLOCKERS/NEXT_PROMPTS. All specs SPEC-001..010 remain done.
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-010 Postgres RLS backstop DONE — all plan specs SPEC-001..010 + TICKET003/009 complete.**
  Applied migration `20260529130000_tenant_rls` (ENABLE+FORCE RLS + `tenant_isolation` policy on 22 tenant
  tables; non-superuser `app_rls` role + grants). Policy allows when `app.current_org_id` is unset → the
  default superuser app path is unaffected (no regression). `lib/db/rls.ts#withTenantRls` enforces via
  transaction-local `set_config` + `SET LOCAL ROLE app_rls` (pooling-safe). Proven by
  `tests/unit/db/rls-isolation.test.ts` (`RUN_DB_TESTS`): app-filter-omitted reads return only the active org;
  cross-tenant insert blocked by `WITH CHECK` (Postgres `42501`). `EXPLAIN` shows the policy predicate applied
  (`orgId` index present; seq scan on the tiny demo table). Verified: 424 tests (RLS test skipped by default)
  + 12 domain gates + typecheck/lint/build/db:validate green; reseed clean. Prod enablement (non-superuser app
  role + per-request `withTenantRls`) documented in the spec + migration header.
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-008 finished — lead score surfaced in the contact UI.** Added a read-only "Lead Score"
  row to `lib/product/contacts.ts` (`formatLeadStatus` → `"<score> · <stage>"` or "Not qualified"; the
  contact detail page already maps `statusRows`, so no page change). Updated the two frozen-row tests + added
  a formatter test (→ 424); seeded a score on the demo contact. **Verified by live render:** started
  `next dev`, fetched the contact detail page, confirmed the HTML shows `Lead Score` + `82 · HOT`; stopped the
  server. typecheck/lint/424 tests/build green. SPEC-008 now fully meets its ACs (inbox surfacing + auto-routing
  remain optional BACKLOG items).
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-008 lead-qualification backend slice DONE.** Extended the `AiProvider` seam with
  `qualifyLead` (fake default + gated live Anthropic via the SPEC-007 `ai:gate`/cap, defensive JSON parse,
  PII-redacted prompt); added tenant-scoped `persistContactLeadQualification` + additive migration
  `20260529120721_lead_qualification_score` (nullable `Contact.leadScore`/`leadStage`/`leadQualifiedAt`);
  refactored the lead-qualification route (analysis-only — no send/consent change); `ai:check` rule + tests
  (+5 → 423). **NOTE:** a transient API 500 had interrupted before verification — re-verified and caught +
  fixed a typecheck bug (nullable `Conversation.contactId` guard). Verified: typecheck/lint/423 tests/build/
  ai:check/db:validate green. UI surfacing of scores deferred to BACKLOG; live enablement human-gated.
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-009 consent-evidence DONE (real migration).** With Postgres up + `prisma generate`
  working (transient EPERM cleared on retry), applied additive migration `20260529115853_consent_evidence`
  (nullable `Contact.consentCapturedAt`/`consentMethod`/`consentDisclosure` — reversible, no data loss).
  Added `CONSENT_EVIDENCE_MISSING` to `evaluateMessagingHardGate` (+ `hasConsentEvidence`), blocker copy,
  `compliance:check` assertion, seed evidence on the demo contact; updated 2 gate fixtures + added a
  missing-evidence test; fixed the frozen blocker-copy list test. Verified (real): db:validate,
  compliance:check, typecheck, lint, **418 tests**, build all green; `db:seed` reseeded the live Postgres.
  e2e:smoke not run (Chromium not installed). Committed on `maint/iter-0001`.
- 2026-05-29 — **TICKET009 demo-safe session seam DONE.** Added `lib/auth/session.ts`
  (`resolveProductionCurrentOrg`: verified subject → active `Membership` → org/role, **fail-closed**;
  `productionAuthIsEnabled`/`clerkConfigIsPresent`, behind `PRODUCTION_AUTH_ENABLED`, DI resolver, **no
  Clerk SDK or secrets**), `tests/unit/auth/session.test.ts` (+6 → 417), extended `production-auth:check`
  + `docs/PRODUCTION_AUTH_RBAC.md` (demo-default/flag-gated/fail-closed assertions; all prior texts kept),
  `.env.example` `PRODUCTION_AUTH_ENABLED=false`. Demo path (`current-org.ts`/`demo-session.ts`) unchanged;
  `production:gate` not weakened. Verified: production-auth:check + typecheck/lint/417 tests/build green;
  e2e not run (no Postgres). Live Clerk enablement (verified-subject binding + deny responses + secrets)
  stays human-gated. Committed on `maint/iter-0001`.
- 2026-05-29 — **SPEC-007 demo-safe slice DONE.** Added the AI provider seam (`lib/ai/provider.ts`:
  `resolveAiProvider` → fake default + gated live Anthropic client, draft-only, phone-PII-redacted prompt),
  a 4-condition hard gate (`lib/ai/ai-gate.ts`), per-tenant live cap + `recordLiveAiUsage` (`lib/ai/usage.ts`),
  refactored `app/api/ai/reply-suggestion/route.ts`, `scripts/ai-check.ts` wired into `validate`
  (now 19 steps / 12 domain gates), `.env.example` flags, `tests/unit/ai/provider-seam.test.ts` (+13 → 411).
  Updated `contracts/CONTRACT-AI.md` to gated-live. Verified (real): typecheck/lint/**411 tests**/build/`ai:check`
  green; `npm run validate` aborts only at the Windows `db:generate` EPERM; e2e not run (no Postgres).
  Live enablement (`AI_API_KEY` + `AI_COST_ACK`) stays human-gated. Committed on `maint/iter-0001`.
- 2026-05-29 — **Reconciliation + re-verification pass (no code change).** Re-ran ground truth on HEAD
  `ada8ac86`: `npm test` **398 pass / 67 files**, `npm run build` **pass**, typecheck/lint/db:validate +
  **11/11** domain gates pass, `npm audit` 2 moderate (unchanged). `npm run validate` **exits 1** at
  `db:generate` (Windows EPERM) — it aborts *before* `test`/`e2e`/`build` (steps 16–18), so those were run
  directly. e2e:smoke not run (no Postgres). Research refresh: Next.js **May-2026** security release (13
  advisories incl. CVE-2026-23864 + middleware-bypass) — installed **15.5.18 is the patched floor**, already
  mitigated; A2P privacy/terms hard-400 confirmed for **2026-06-30**. Updated `plan/CONTEXT.md` (verified
  state, May-2026 CVEs, A2P date), `RISK_REGISTER` (R10), `BACKLOG` (Prisma-7 driver adapters), `AGENTS`
  (18-step), `EXECUTION_PROMPT` (v2026.05.29). **Top unblocked real-work item = SPEC-007 provider seam**
  (no seam exists yet; secret/key part stays human-gated).
- 2026-05-29 — **Execution ceiling reached; human chose to STOP.** 8/10 specs done + committed
  (SPEC-001/002/003/004/005/006 + TICKET003 + SPEC-009 quiet-hours); 398 unit tests green; 15/15 local
  gates green except `db:generate` (unresolvable Windows `prisma generate` EPERM — engine DLL held by an
  unkillable harness/IDE process; client already valid). Remaining 4 are categorically gated and were NOT
  attempted: SPEC-007 (live-AI hard gate + secrets), SPEC-008 (migration + secrets), SPEC-009
  consent-evidence (migration), SPEC-010 (migration), TICKET009 (Clerk hard gate + secrets). Per the
  Destructive-Actions + Secrets guardrails I declined to run unconfirmed migrations or fabricate secrets.
  Next: complete the gated specs in a credentialed Linux/CI environment via `plan/EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`.
- 2026-05-29 — SPEC-005 DONE (commit `e1565201`): aligned `package.json` carets to installed patched
  versions (within current majors), resynced `package-lock.json` via `--package-lock-only` (no EPERM),
  Redis pinned `7.4-alpine`. typecheck/lint/test/build green. All non-gated specs are now complete.
- 2026-05-29 — SPEC-009 pt.1 DONE: TCPA quiet-hours. Added `lib/compliance/quiet-hours.ts`, optional
  `quietHours` input on `evaluateMessagingHardGate` (`lib/compliance/gates.ts`),
  `tests/unit/compliance/quiet-hours.test.ts` (→ 398 tests), matrix compliance row. 7/7 gate sweep green.
  Consent-evidence storage deferred — needs a Prisma migration (human confirmation per guardrails).
- 2026-05-29 — SPEC-006 core DONE (commit `115bb435`) + contract docs for the reply endpoint
  (`6b618148`, completing TICKET003's `contracts:check`). Added `lib/observability/logger.ts` (PII-safe
  redactor), `lib/observability/metrics.ts`, root `instrumentation.ts` (flag-gated, default off),
  `tests/unit/observability/logger.test.ts` (+5 → 393), extended `scripts/observability-check.ts`,
  `.env.example` (`OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=false`). Full local gate 15/15 green (db:generate=Windows flake;
  e2e verified earlier). OTel exporter wiring deferred to BACKLOG.
- 2026-05-29 — TICKET003 DONE: demo-safe outbound inbox reply. Files: `lib/validation/inbox.ts`
  (`conversationReplyCreateSchema`), `lib/db/repositories/inbox.ts` (`createConversationOutboundReply` —
  dummy provider, opt-out/archived block, idempotent OUTBOUND upsert), new
  `app/api/inbox/conversations/[conversationId]/reply/route.ts` (POST, MEMBER), `lib/auth/api-rbac-matrix.ts`
  (matrix entry), `app/dashboard/inbox/workspace.tsx` (reply form), `tests/unit/api/inbox-json-route.test.ts`
  (+4 tests → 388 total), `docs/CURRENT_STATE_MATRIX.md` (inbox row). Verified: typecheck, lint, build,
  test (388), context:check, security:check green. SPEC-005 caret bump deferred (Windows `npm install`
  prisma EPERM risk); compose Redis pin already done.
- 2026-05-28 — SPEC-003 done (security headers + CSP-Report-Only + `security:check` gate; headers verified
  served live, `X-Powered-By` removed). Brought up Docker postgres+redis and **verified the full e2e path
  locally**: `db:deploy` (14 migrations) → `demo:seed` → `test:e2e:smoke` **passed** — proving the SPEC-002
  CI workflow. `build` green with new headers. SPEC-005: compose Redis pinned `7.4-alpine`. KNOWN LOCAL
  FLAKE: `db:generate` hits a Windows `EPERM` DLL-rename lock (Defender/antivirus); the Prisma client is
  already generated & valid (db:validate/typecheck/tests/build/e2e all pass using it); Linux CI unaffected.
- 2026-05-28 — Executed Phase-0 quick wins: SPEC-001 (start script, verified `npm start`→200),
  SPEC-004 (README rewrite 152→54), SPEC-002 (CI postgres+redis services + migrate/seed; CI-pending).
  14/14 local gates green after changes; e2e not run (no local Postgres). Changed: `package.json`,
  `README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/premerge.yml`.
- 2026-05-28 — Plan authored (`plan/` created). Baseline + research in `plan/CONTEXT.md`. No code changed
  by the planning pass. Repo gate state at authoring: 16/16 local gates green, e2e not run (no Postgres).
